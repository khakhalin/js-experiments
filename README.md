js-experiments
==============

My collection of JS programs for teaching and research. More info will come soon.

Direct links to working versions of these programs are given [on my web-page](https://sites.google.com/view/khakhalin/research/programs)

Most of these programs use p5 library, and require p5 to be placed in a neighboring folder (in other words, library script tags at the beginning of each file are pointing at src="../p5/p5.js").
