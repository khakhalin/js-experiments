js-experiments
==============

A collection of JavaScript programs for teaching and research.

Direct links to working versions of these programs are given [here](https://sites.google.com/view/khakhalin/research/programs)

All programs rely on the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/); currently tested with version v0.9.0 (released July 01, 2019). To work properly, these scripts require the p5 library to be placed in a neighboring folder (in other words, script tags at the beginning of each file are pointing at src="../p5/p5.js").
